# Data Engineering and Python Portfolio: A Symphony of Code

Welcome to my portfolio repository, a unique collection of data engineering and Python projects, creatively structured as a metaphor for classical music. Inspired by the intricate harmony of musical compositions, this repository showcases my technical skills and growth as a developer through three distinct stages — Prélude, Étude, and Fugue — each symbolizing a different level of complexity and mastery.

Just as musical scores translate human emotion into a universal language, the scripts in this repository convert data into actionable insights. The art of coding parallels the art of composing; both require precision, creativity, and a deep understanding of structure. Explore the repository and experience how code and sheet music resonate across different domains.

## Repository Structure

### Prelude
The Prelude section introduces foundational concepts through beginner-level scripts. Like an opening melody, these notebooks set the tone for future exploration.

- **hello_world.ipynb**: The classic "Hello, World!" program.
- **variables.ipynb**: Basics of variables in Python.
- **operators.ipynb**: Introduction to operators and expressions.
- **conditional_statements.ipynb**: Fundamental conditional logic.

---

### Etude
Étude represents practice and skill refinement. This section focuses on data manipulation and processing tasks, divided into two projects.

#### Project_Data_manipulating
Subprojects exploring text transformation, cleaning, and divisibility tests:
- **transforming_text.ipynb**
- **transformation_and_cleaning.ipynb**
- **divisibility_test.ipynb**
- **cleanin_and_filter_order_data.ipynb**

#### Project_Data_processing
A deeper dive into real-world data:
- **json_scraping.ipynb**: Extracting information from a spotify playlist.
- **web_scraping.ipynb**: Extracting information from the web.
- **chicago_data_to_mapping.ipynb**: Data visualization and analysis.

---

### Fugue
The Fugue section showcases advanced projects, emphasizing complexity and parallelism. Inspired by the polyphonic structure of fugues, these notebooks represent sophisticated pipelines and integrations.

#### Project_Data_ETL
Scripts for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations and visualization:
- **AWS_Lambda_Chicago_taxi_extract.ipynb**
- **AWS_Lambda_Chicago_taxi_transform_load.ipynb**
- **Local_visualisations.ipynb**
